/*The Fortune Teller
Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Write a function named tellFortune that:

takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.
*/

const tellFortune = function (jobTitle, geoLocation, partner, numKids)
{
    console.log( `You will be a ${jobTitle} in ${geoLocation} and married to ${partner} with ${numKids} kids.` );
  }

/*The Puppy Age Calculator
You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!

Write a function named calculateDogAge that:

takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"
Call the function three times with different sets of values.
Bonus: Add an additional argument to the function that takes the conversion rate of human to dog years.
*/

const calculateDogAge = function (puppyAge) {
const conversionRate = 7;
const dogYears = puppyAge * conversionRate;
console.console.log(`Your doggie is ${dogYears} years old in dog years!`);
};

calculateDogAge(1);
calculateDogAge(2);
calculateDogAge(3);

/*The Lifetime Supply Calculator
Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

Write a function named calculateSupply that:

takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.
*/






/*The Geometrizer
Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle.

Create a function called calcCircumfrence:

Pass the radius to the function.
Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
Create a function called calcArea:

Pass the radius to the function.
Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".
*/





/*The Temperature Converter
It's hot out! Let's make a converter.

Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:

Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN°C is NN°F".
Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:
Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.

Convert it to celsius and output "NN°F is NN°C."
