/*The Calculator
Part 1
Write a function called squareNumber that will take one argument (a number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."
Write a function called halfNumber that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should also log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".
Write a function called percentOf that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."
Write a function called areaOfCircle that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172."
Bonus: Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.
*/


/*Part 2
Write a function that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations, using the functions you wrote earlier1:

Take half of the number and store the result.
Square the result of #1 and store that result.
Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.
Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3).*/


function squareNumber(num) {
    var squaredNumber = num * num;
    console.log('The result of squaring the number ' + num + ' is ' + squaredNumber);
    return squaredNumber;
}

squareNumber(3);

function halfOf(num) {
    var half = num / 2;
    console.log('Half of ' + num + ' is ' +  half);
    return half;
}

halfOf(5);

function percentOf(num1, num2) {
    var percent = (num1/num2) * 100;
    console.log(num1 + ' is ' + percent + '% of ' + num2);
    return percent;
}

percentOf(5, 10);

function areaOfCircle(radius) {
    var area = Math.PI * squareNumber(radius);
    console.log('The area of circle with radius ' + radius + ' is ' + area);
    return area;
}

areaOfCircle(2);

function doCrazyStuff(num) {
    var half    = halfOf(num);
    var squared = squareNumber(half);
    var area    = areaOfCircle(squared);
    var result  = percentOf(squared, area);
}

doCrazyStuff(5);



/*Strings
These exercises will test your knowledge of string functions, conditionals, and arrays. For many of them, you will want to consult the JavaScript strings reference to find useful string methods to call.

DrEvil
Create a function called DrEvil. It should take a single argument, an amount, and return ' dollars', except it will add '(pinky)' at the end if the amount is 1 million. For example:

  DrEvil(10): 10 dollars
  DrEvil(1000000): 1000000 dollars (pinky)
  */



  function drEvil(amount) {
  if (amount == 1000000) {
    return amount + " dollars (pinky)";
  } else {
    return amount + " dollars";
  }
}
